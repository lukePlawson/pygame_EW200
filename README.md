# pygame_EW200
 
 ## This is a project for my EW200 class... involves a truck and tracks for a timed race
 #### You will first see the instructions screen where you will press a button to start the countdown... after this you will then be on the screen where you are attempting to get the truck to the black finish line which is right behind you, however blocked off by water. Navigate the track as fast as possible and see if you get the best score.
